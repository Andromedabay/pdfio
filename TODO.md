To-Do List
==========

- Binary data/strings: needed for certain values, particular for the File ID
  and user/owner passwords
- Copy methods for array, dict, object, page
- How to handle object references between documents, i.e., if I copy a page from
  one PDF to another, there are a bunch of resources that also need to be
  copied. A dictionary with an object reference can't be copied directly as the
  object number in the new PDF will likely be different than the old one.
